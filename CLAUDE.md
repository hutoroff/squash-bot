# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A Telegram bot for managing squash game coordination among friends. The bot handles game announcements, player registration via inline buttons ("I'm in"/"I'll skip"), guest management, capacity validation, dynamic group tracking, and automated cleanup.

## Architecture

```
telegram  →  HTTP API  →  management  →  PostgreSQL
booking   →  eversports.de  (reverse-engineered cookie-auth API)
```

Four independent binaries in one Go module (`github.com/hutoroff/squash-bot`): `management` (API + scheduler, port 8080), `telegram` (bot, no DB), `booking` (Eversports wrapper, port 8081), `web` (SPA + JWT auth, port 8082). See AGENTS.md for directory structure.

### Database Schema
- `games`: id, chat_id, message_id, game_date, courts_count, courts, venue_id (nullable FK→venues), notified_day_before, completed, created_at
- `players`: id, telegram_id (UNIQUE), username, first_name, last_name, created_at
- `game_participations`: id, game_id, player_id, status ('registered'|'skipped'), created_at, UNIQUE(game_id, player_id)
- `guest_participations`: id, game_id, invited_by_player_id, created_at
- `bot_groups`: chat_id PK, title, bot_is_admin, language (VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT 'en'), timezone (VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT 'UTC'), added_at
- `venues`: id, group_id (FK→bot_groups), name, courts (comma-separated), time_slots (comma-separated HH:MM), address (nullable), grace_period_hours (INT DEFAULT 24), game_days (TEXT DEFAULT ''), booking_opens_days (INT DEFAULT 14), last_booking_reminder_at (TIMESTAMPTZ nullable), preferred_game_time (TEXT DEFAULT ''), last_auto_booking_at (TIMESTAMPTZ nullable), auto_booking_courts (TEXT DEFAULT ''), auto_booking_enabled (BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE), created_at, UNIQUE(group_id, name)
- `auto_booking_results`: id, venue_id (FK→venues ON DELETE CASCADE), game_date (DATE), courts (comma-separated court numbers), courts_count (INT), created_at, UNIQUE(venue_id, game_date)
- `venue_credentials`: id, venue_id (FK→venues ON DELETE CASCADE), login (TEXT NOT NULL), enc_password (TEXT NOT NULL, AES-256-GCM encrypted, never returned by API), priority (INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0), max_courts (INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 3), last_error_at (TIMESTAMPTZ nullable), created_at, UNIQUE(venue_id, login)
- `court_bookings`: id BIGSERIAL PK, venue_id (FK→venues ON DELETE CASCADE), game_date DATE, court_uuid TEXT, court_label TEXT (name-extracted number e.g. "7"), match_id TEXT UNIQUE, booking_uuid TEXT, credential_id BIGINT (nullable FK→venue_credentials ON DELETE SET NULL; NULL = booked with env-var credentials), canceled_at TIMESTAMPTZ (NULL = active booking; set on soft-delete), created_at

## Versioning & Release

Each service has its own independent version stored in a plain-text file:
- `cmd/management/VERSION`
- `cmd/telegram/VERSION`
- `cmd/booking/VERSION`
- `cmd/web/VERSION`

Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD` (e.g. `1.0.33`).

Version is injected at build time via `-ldflags "-X main.Version=<ver>"` and logged on startup. The management service exposes `GET /version` (unauthenticated, like `/health`) returning `{"version": "1.0.33"}`.

**API compatibility rule**: services are compatible within the same major version. The telegram bot calls `GET /version` on the management service at startup and exits with an error if the major versions differ.

### Releasing a service

Trigger the relevant GitHub Actions workflow manually:
- **Actions → Release Management Service** for `management`
- **Actions → Release Telegram Bot** for `telegram`
- **Actions → Release Booking Service** for `booking`
- **Actions → Release Web Service** for `web`

Select bump type (`patch` / `minor` / `major`). The workflow will:
1. Verify CI passed for the exact HEAD commit (fails immediately otherwise). The web release additionally verifies the `frontend-test` job alongside `build-and-test`.
2. Bump the `VERSION` file.
3. Build and push Docker images tagged `<version>` and `latest` to both Docker Hub and GHCR.
4. Commit the bumped `VERSION` back to the branch and create a git tag (`management/vX.Y.Z`, `telegram/vX.Y.Z`, `booking/vX.Y.Z`, or `web/vX.Y.Z`).

**Required GitHub configuration (one-time setup):**
- Variable `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` — Docker Hub org or username for image names.
- Secret `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` — Docker Hub access token with push rights.
- Secret `RELEASE_PAT` — a Personal Access Token (classic: `repo` scope; fine-grained: `Contents: Read and Write`) whose owner is listed as a bypass actor in the branch-protection rule for `main`. Required so the "Commit and tag" step can push the VERSION bump directly to a protected branch. `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot bypass branch protection.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used automatically for GHCR pushes and the check-runs API.

Image names follow the pattern (service → image name):
```
management  →  <DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/squash-management:<version>
telegram    →  <DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/squash-telegram-bot:<version>
booking     →  <DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/squash-booking-eversports:<version>
web         →  <DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/squash-web:<version>
```

## Key Business Logic Workflows

### Localisation
- **Group messages** (game announcements, scheduled notifications) use the language stored in `bot_groups.language`; fetched via `groupLocalizer(ctx, chatID)` which calls `GET /api/v1/groups/{chatID}`.
- **Private messages** use the language from the Telegram user's `LanguageCode` field via `userLocalizer(langCode)`, falling back to English.
- Three languages are supported: `en` (default), `de`, `ru`. `i18n.Normalize()` maps any Telegram locale string to one of these.
- Scheduler notifications (`CancellationReminderJob`, `DayAfterCleanupJob`) use `groupRepo.GetByID()` directly to resolve group language via the `groupLang` helper in `group_resolver.go`. Booking reminders use `userLocalizer` with the admin's Telegram `LanguageCode`.
- Date formatting is locale-aware: English "Sunday, March 22", German "Sonntag, 22. März", Russian "Воскресенье, 22 марта".

### Language & Timezone Selection (`/language`)
1. User runs `/language` in private chat.
2. If admin in exactly one group → show language picker inline keyboard for that group immediately.
3. If admin in multiple groups → show group picker first (`set_lang_group:<groupID>` callbacks), then language picker.
4. Language picker shows 3 language buttons + a "🕐 Set Timezone" button.
5. Language buttons send `set_lang:<lang>:<groupID>` callback → `PATCH /api/v1/groups/{chatID}/language` → `bot_groups.language` updated.
6. "Set Timezone" button sends `set_tz_pick:<groupID>` → shows curated timezone picker (18 IANA timezones, 2 per row).
7. Timezone button sends `set_tz:<groupID>:<tz>` → `PATCH /api/v1/groups/{chatID}/timezone` → `bot_groups.timezone` updated.
8. `PATCH /timezone` returns 400 for invalid IANA timezone strings, 404 if group not found.

### Venue Management (`/venues`)
Works in **private chat only**.

1. Admin sends `/venues` → shows venue list for their group (or group picker if multiple groups).
2. Each venue row shows "Edit" and "Delete" buttons; "Add Venue" button at the bottom.
3. **Add venue wizard**: name → courts (comma-separated) → time slots (comma-separated HH:MM, `-` to skip) → preferred game time (inline buttons from time_slots, skipped if no time_slots entered) → address (optional, `-` to skip) → game days (toggle inline keyboard; tap days to toggle, press "✓ Confirm" to proceed — confirming with nothing selected skips the field) → grace period hours (integer or `-` for default 24) → **auto-booking enabled** (inline "Enable"/"Disable" buttons; default disabled) → auto-booking courts (ordered subset or `-`; only shown when auto-booking was enabled) → booking opens days (integer or `-` for default 14) → venue created.
4. **Edit venue**: clicking a venue opens an edit menu showing current values and buttons for each field. Free-text fields (Name, Courts, Time Slots, Address, Grace Period, Auto-booking Courts, Booking Opens): admin sends new value as a message. Inline-keyboard fields: Game Days uses the toggle keyboard (tap days + Confirm); Preferred Time shows buttons for each configured time slot plus a "✕ No preference" option. When `auto_booking_enabled = true`, a "🔑 Credentials" button also appears (see below).
5. **Delete venue**: two-step confirmation; blocked with an error message if the venue has active `court_bookings` (HTTP 409 from the management API). Linked games retain their `venue_id` as NULL (ON DELETE SET NULL).
6. **Credential management**: Tapping "🔑 Credentials" shows a list of stored credentials (masked login, priority, max_courts) and "Add" / "Delete" buttons. The "🔑 Credentials" button is only shown when the venue has `auto_booking_enabled = true`; disabling auto-booking hides the button but never deletes credentials. Credentials require `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to be set on the management service. The add-credential wizard collects: login (email) → priority (integer; current in-use values are shown) → max courts per credential (integer or `-` for default 3) → password (message deleted immediately for security). Passwords are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage and are never returned by the API or bot. Deletion requires a two-step confirmation.

**Venue fields:**
- `grace_period_hours`: hours before game when cancellation reminder fires (default 24). Reminder time = `game_date - (grace_period_hours + 6) hours`.
- `game_days`: comma-separated weekday ints (Go `time.Weekday`: Sunday=0, Monday=1, …, Saturday=6). Used for booking reminder schedule.
- `booking_opens_days`: how many days ahead booking opens (default 14). Included in booking reminder DM text.
- `preferred_game_time`: a single HH:MM slot (must be one of `time_slots`, or empty for no preference). Displayed with ⭐ in the new-game wizard time slot keyboard. Set via `venue_edit_preferred_time` button or the venue creation wizard.
- `auto_booking_enabled`: whether automatic court booking is enabled for this venue (default false). `RunAutoBooking` skips venues where this is false. Toggled via `venue_toggle_autobooking:<venueID>:<groupID>` callback or set during venue creation wizard.
- `auto_booking_courts`: ordered comma-separated court numbers (subset of `courts`) that `RunAutoBooking` will attempt to book, in declared priority order. Empty means any eligible free court is booked in API response order. Validated: each number must be present in `courts`. Only editable (via `venue_edit_auto_booking_courts` button) when `auto_booking_enabled = true`. Set in venue creation wizard only if auto-booking was enabled at the enable/disable step. **Matching is done by name-extracted number**: `filterFreeCourts` calls `extractCourtNumber("Court 7") → 7` and matches that against the numbers stored in `courts`/`auto_booking_courts`. This avoids the Eversports facility-specific ID mismatch (e.g. Eversports ID `77385` vs user label `1`). Occupancy, by contrast, is checked by Eversports numeric court ID (`sl.Court` from `ListMatches` vs `strconv.Atoi(c.ID)` from `ListCourts`). If no courts from `ListCourts` match the name-number set in `courts`, `filterFreeCourts` falls back to all free courts in API response order.

Callbacks: `venue_list:{groupID}`, `venue_add:{groupID}`, `venue_edit:{venueID}`, `venue_edit_name/courts/slots/addr/gamedays/graceperiod/preferred_time/auto_booking_courts/booking_opens_days:{venueID}:{groupID}`, `venue_delete:{venueID}:{groupID}`, `venue_delete_ok:{venueID}:{groupID}`, `venue_day_toggle:{dayNum}`, `venue_day_confirm:_`, `venue_wiz_ptime:{slot|_skip}`, `venue_ptime_set:{venueID}:{slot|_clear}`, `venue_wiz_autobooking:{enable|disable}`, `venue_toggle_autobooking:{venueID}:{groupID}`, `venue_creds:{venueID}:{groupID}`, `venue_cred_add:{venueID}:{groupID}`, `venue_cred_del:{credID}:{venueID}:{groupID}`, `venue_cred_del_ok:{credID}:{venueID}:{groupID}`.
State: `pendingVenueWizard sync.Map` (chatID → `*venueWizard`), `pendingVenueEdit sync.Map` (chatID → `*venueEditState`), `pendingVenueGameDaysEdit sync.Map` (chatID → `*venueGameDaysEditState`), `pendingVenuePreferredTimeEdit sync.Map` (chatID → `*venuePreferredTimeEditState`), `pendingVenueCredAdd sync.Map` (chatID → `*venueCredWizard` — steps: `venueCredStepLogin` → `venueCredStepPriority` → `venueCredStepMaxCourts` → `venueCredStepPassword`).

### New Game Wizard (`/newGame`)
Works in **private chat only**. Group @mentions are redirected to private chat.

At least one venue must be configured per group before creating a game. `/newGame` fails immediately (or at group-selection time for multi-group admins) if no venues exist.

**Single-group admin:**
1. Admin sends `/newGame` → checked for venues immediately; date-picker keyboard shown (today + next 13 days).
2. Admin taps a date → callback `ng_date:<YYYY-MM-DD>` → if 1 venue: auto-select + court toggle; if 2+: venue picker shown.
3. Admin selects a venue → callback `ng_venue:<venueID>` → court toggle buttons (one per court, ✓ when selected) + Confirm button.
4. Admin toggles courts (`ng_court_toggle:<court>`) and confirms (`ng_court_confirm:_`) → time slot buttons (one per slot + "Custom time").
5. Admin selects a slot (`ng_timeslot:<HH:MM>`) or "Custom time" (`ng_time_custom:_`, reverts to free-text) → game created.

**Multi-group admin:**
1. Admin sends `/newGame` → date-picker keyboard.
2. Admin taps a date → callback `ng_date:<YYYY-MM-DD>` → group picker shown (`ng_group:<groupID>` buttons).
3. Admin selects a group → callback `ng_group:<groupID>` → venues fetched for that group; if 0: error (fail); if 1: auto-select + court toggle; if 2+: venue picker.
4. From here, same as single-group admin steps 3–5.
5. Sending any slash command at any step cancels the wizard (`pendingNewGameWizard.Delete`).

State: `pendingNewGameWizard sync.Map` keyed by private `chatID int64`, value `*newGameWizard`.
Wizard steps: `wizardStepGroup` (group picker, multi-group only), `wizardStepVenue` (venue picker), `wizardStepCourtPick` (court toggle), `wizardStepTime` (time input), `wizardStepCourts` (courts free text).
New game callbacks: `ng_date`, `ng_group`, `ng_venue`, `ng_court_toggle`, `ng_court_confirm`, `ng_timeslot`, `ng_time_custom`.

### Courts Update (`/games` → Manage → Edit Courts)
When an admin taps "Edit Courts" in the `/games` manage screen:
- If the game has a linked venue with courts configured → an inline court-toggle keyboard is shown (same ✓ toggle UX as new game creation). Pre-selects the courts already set on the game. Confirming calls `manage_court_confirm:<gameID>`.
- If the game has no venue → falls back to free-text input as before.

Callbacks: `manage_court_toggle:<court>` (toggle), `manage_court_confirm:<gameID>` (confirm and save).
State: `pendingManageCourtsToggle sync.Map` (chatID → `*manageCourtsToggleState`). Cleared on any slash command.

### Button Click Flow
1. Parse callback data (`action:game_id`, e.g. `join:123`, `skip:123`)
2. Update `game_participations` table (upsert player, add/remove guest)
3. Query current participants and guests for the game
4. Format message with updated participant list + "Last updated" footer (using group language via `groupLocalizer`)
5. Edit Telegram message in place (preserving buttons and pin status)
6. Log action at INFO level

### Scheduled Tasks (Cron-based)
A single 5-minute poll cron (`CRON_POLL`, default `*/5 * * * *`) calls `Scheduler.RunScheduledTasks()` which calls `run(false)` on each registered job. `Scheduler.ForceRun(event)` calls `run(true)` on the named job, bypassing time-window gates. Each job is an independent struct implementing the unexported `scheduledJob` interface (`run(force bool)` + `name() string`).

- **`CancellationReminderJob`** (`cancellation_reminder.go`): Loads all upcoming unnotified games. For each game, computes `reminderAt = game_date - (gracePeriodHours + 6) * hour`. If `|now - reminderAt| ≤ 2m30s`, checks capacity, attempts automatic court cancellation (if `SPORTS_BOOKING_SERVICE_URL` is configured), and **always** sends a group notification. If automatic cancellation fails (infrastructure error or Eversports API error from `CancelMatch`), all group admins also receive a silent DM with the error details. Uses `notified_day_before` flag to prevent duplicates. `gracePeriodHours` defaults to 24 if venue has none configured.

  **Court cancellation flow** (when booking service URL is configured):
  1. Computes `courtsToCancel = floor((capacity − count) / 2)` — fully unused courts (each needs 2 free spots).
  2. **Two-path dispatch** based on whether `court_bookings` entries exist for this venue+date:
     - **New path (credential-aware)**: if `court_bookings` entries are found, `cancelUsingBookingEntries` is called. Each entry carries its own `credential_id`; `GetDecryptedByID` fetches the login/password for that credential (nil = env-var fallback). The same phase-1/phase-2 priority selection runs on the `court_label` values from the entries instead of from a live `ListMatches` call. After each successful cancellation, `MarkCanceled` soft-deletes the entry.
     - **Legacy fallback**: if no entries exist (transition period — courts booked before this feature, or outside auto-booking), calls `GET /api/v1/eversports/matches?date=…&startTime=…&endTime=startTime+10m&my=true` to get own bookings, then cancels with env-var credentials (empty login/password).
  3. Selects courts to cancel in two phases (both paths):
     - **Phase 1 — priority order** (when the game's venue has `auto_booking_courts` configured): iterates `auto_booking_courts` in **reverse** (lowest-priority first) and picks courts that are actually booked, up to `courtsToCancel`. In the new path this uses entry `court_label`; in the legacy path it calls `ListCourts` to build an ID → name-number map. If `ListCourts` fails, Phase 1 is skipped.
     - **Phase 2 — consecutive-grouping fallback**: applies the grouping algorithm to remaining booked courts: split by consecutive-run, pick from the smallest group (tie-break by lowest first court), cancel from the end of that group.
  4. Cancels selected courts one-by-one via `DELETE /api/v1/eversports/matches/{matchUUID}` (with credentials if available). Partial failures do not abort remaining cancellations. Per-court `CancelMatch` errors are collected in `courtCancellationResult.cancelErrors`.
  5. Updates `games.courts` / `games.courts_count` in the DB.

  **Notification scenarios** (always sent to the group, determined after cancellation):
  - `all_good` — count ≥ newCapacity: "upcoming game, courts confirmed".
  - `canceled_balanced` — courts canceled and count now == newCapacity: "courts X canceled, all set".
  - `odd_no_cancel` — odd player count, nothing canceled, 1 free spot: "1 free spot".
  - `odd_canceled` — odd player count, some courts canceled, 1 free spot: "courts X canceled, 1 free spot".
  - `all_canceled` — all courts canceled: "game will not happen".
  - `even_no_cancel` — even player count, count < capacity, nothing (or not enough) canceled: "please cancel unused courts". Fires when the booking service is absent or found no owned bookings.

  **Admin DM on cancellation failure** (silent, sent in addition to the group message): fired when `cancelErr != nil` (infrastructure error — e.g. `ListMatches` or DB write failed) **or** when `result.cancelErrors` is non-empty (one or more `CancelMatch` calls returned an Eversports API error). The DM includes the game date/time and the error text so admins know to cancel courts manually.

- **`BookingReminderJob`** (`booking_reminder.go`): Iterates all groups. For each group, checks if local time (using `bot_groups.timezone`) is in the `[10:00, 10:05)` window. For each venue of that group with `game_days` configured, checks if today's weekday is in `game_days`. Deduplicates via `venues.last_booking_reminder_at` (date-scoped). After the dedup check, queries `GetUncompletedGamesByGroupAndDay` for the target date (`today + booking_opens_days`); if a game already exists for that day the reminder is skipped entirely (dedup guard is NOT updated, so the check retries on the next poll). Then queries `auto_booking_results` for the venue + target date:
  - **If a stored auto-booking result exists**: creates a `Game` record with the booked courts and posts the standard game announcement to the group (formatted via `gameformat.FormatGameMessage`, inline keyboard via `GameKeyboard`), pins it silently, and updates `message_id`. No admin DM is sent. If game creation or the Telegram send fails, falls back to DMing admins.
  - **If no result exists** (auto-booking didn't run or failed): DMs all non-bot group admins with the venue name and `booking_opens_days`, using Markdown formatting. The DM message reads: *"Booking is open now! Game in N days — don't forget to reserve courts."*

- **`AutoBookingJob`** (`auto_booking.go`): Iterates all groups. For each group, checks if local time is in the `[00:00, 00:05)` window. For each venue with `auto_booking_enabled = true` and `game_days` and `preferred_game_time` configured, checks if today's weekday is in `game_days`. Deduplicates via `venues.last_auto_booking_at` (date-scoped). If conditions met and `bookingClient` is set:
  1. Calls `ListCourts(date)` to get all courts at the facility for the target date.
  2. Calls `ListMatches(date, HHMM, HHMM, false)` (same value for both startTime and endTime) for the exact `preferred_game_time`. **Courts appearing in this response are occupied** (reserved, training, or club-blocked — including those showing `booking: null`). Courts **absent** from this response are truly free for ad-hoc booking.
  3. Selects free courts via `filterFreeCourts`: matches by **name-extracted number** (`extractCourtNumber("Court 7") → 7`) against the numbers in `courts`; falls back to all free courts if no name-numbers match `courts`. Within the eligible set, if `auto_booking_courts` is set and any preferred court is free, returns those in declared priority order; otherwise returns all eligible free courts in API response order. Occupancy is checked by Eversports numeric ID (integer `sl.Court` from `ListMatches` vs `strconv.Atoi(c.ID)` from `ListCourts`).
  4. **Credential rotation**: calls `VenueCredentialService.ListForBooking(venueID, cooldown)` to get usable credentials ordered by priority. Credentials with `last_error_at` within the cooldown window (`CREDENTIAL_ERROR_COOLDOWN`, default 24h) are excluded. If the list is empty, notifies group admins **with sound** and returns without booking. For each credential, books up to `min(cred.MaxCourts, remaining)` courts via `BookMatch(courtUUID, start, end, login, password)`. On per-credential error: calls `VenueCredentialService.MarkError(credID)` (sets `last_error_at = NOW()`), notifies admins **with sound** (login, error, cooldown), puts the failed court back into the available pool, and advances to the next credential. After all credentials are exhausted, if courts remain unbooked a "credentials exhausted" DM is sent silently.
  5. On success: saves a `court_bookings` entry per booked court (venue_id, game_date, court_uuid, court_label, match_id, booking_uuid, credential_id); if `match_id` is empty the entry is skipped and a warning is logged. Also persists the booked courts to `auto_booking_results` (venue_id, game_date, courts, courts_count) for `BookingReminderJob` to consume at 10:00; DMs all group admins silently (`DisableNotification=true`); sets `last_auto_booking_at`.
  6. **Three admin notification types**: `notifyNoCredentials` (sound on, no creds available), `notifyCredentialError` (sound on, per-credential failure — includes login, error, cooldown), `notifyCredentialsExhausted` (silent, all creds tried but courts remain).

- **`DayAfterCleanupJob`** (`day_after_cleanup.go`): Iterates all groups. For each group, checks if local time is in the `[03:00, 03:05)` window. Fetches yesterday's uncompleted games for that group. Unpins message, removes keyboard, marks game complete.

Manual trigger via `/trigger` (service admins only) uses the event names `cancellation_reminder`, `booking_reminder`, `day_after_cleanup`, `auto_booking`. Each event routes to `Scheduler.ForceRun(event)` which calls `run(true)` on the matching job, bypassing the time-window scheduling gate (e.g. `[00:00, 00:05)` for auto-booking, `±pollWindow` for cancellation reminders) but still respects `game_days` validation and same-day dedup guards (`last_auto_booking_at`, `last_booking_reminder_at`, `notified_day_before`).

### Admin & Group Management
- **Group admin rights** are verified dynamically per group via `GetChatAdministrators` — no hardcoded IDs; this controls game creation, player/guest management, and all `/games` actions
- **Service admin access** (`SERVICE_ADMIN_IDS` env var) is a separate, operator-configured set of Telegram user IDs that grants access to `/trigger` only; it is independent of group membership or Telegram admin status
- `my_chat_member` events track when the bot is added/removed/promoted/demoted
- If added without admin rights, bot DMs the user who added it

### Guest Management
- Players can add guests (+1) linked to their player record
- Players can remove their own most-recently-added guest
- Admins can remove any guest via the `/games` management menu

### Web Authentication (`web`)
Authentication uses the [Telegram Login Widget](https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login).

**Flow:**
1. `GET /api/config` returns `{"bot_name":"<TELEGRAM_BOT_NAME>"}` — frontend uses this to render the widget.
2. User clicks the widget button and approves in the Telegram app.
3. Telegram redirects the browser to `GET /api/auth/callback?id=…&first_name=…&auth_date=…&hash=…`.
4. Backend verifies the HMAC-SHA256 hash: `key = SHA256(TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN)`, `sig = hex(HMAC-SHA256(key, sorted_key=value_pairs))`. Also checks `auth_date` is ≤ 86400 s old.
5. Backend calls `GET /api/v1/players/{telegramID}` on the management service (with `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`). Returns `player_id` if the user has previously used the Telegram bot; `nil` if not (login still succeeds).
6. Backend issues a signed HS256 JWT (`JWT_SECRET`, 7-day expiry) and sets it as an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax `session` cookie. The `Secure` flag is set when `r.TLS != nil` **or** `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` (covers TLS-terminating proxies).
7. `GET /api/auth/me` — returns `200` + user JSON from the cookie, or `401` if absent/expired/invalid.
8. `POST /api/auth/logout` — expires the cookie.
9. `GET /api/games` — returns a JSON array of the authenticated user's games (see below). Player ID is read from the JWT claim only — never from a query parameter. If `player_id` is absent from the JWT (user logged in before their first bot interaction), a live `lookupPlayer` call is made by `TelegramID`; if a record is now found the session cookie is refreshed in the same response with an updated JWT so subsequent requests skip the re-lookup. Returns `[]` when no player record exists yet; returns `502` on management service errors.

**BotFather setup (one-time per deployment):** `/mybots` → select bot → Bot Settings → Domain → enter the public hostname (no `https://`). `localhost` is not accepted; use a tunnel (e.g. ngrok) for local end-to-end testing.

**Management service endpoints used by the web service:**
- `GET /api/v1/players/{telegramID}` — returns the `players` row for the given Telegram user ID (`200` + JSON) or `404` if not found. Used during login to populate `player_id` in the JWT.
- `GET /api/v1/players/{playerID}/games` — returns all `PlayerGame` records for a player (newest first). Each item: `id`, `game_date`, `courts_count`, `courts`, `completed`, `participation_status` (`registered`|`skipped`), `participant_count` (registered players + guests), `venue_name`, `venue_address`, `group_title`, `timezone`. Used by `GET /api/games`. Both endpoints require bearer auth.

### Web Participation Flow (`web`)

The SPA lets authenticated users manage their participation from the browser. The past-games section is **collapsed by default**; `GameCard` components for past games are not mounted until the user expands the section, which avoids unnecessary `GET /api/games/{id}/participants` calls.

**Web API endpoints (all require the `session` cookie; player ID taken from JWT only):**

| Method   | Path                             | Action                                      |
|----------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/api/games/{id}/participants`   | Return participants + guests for a game     |
| `POST`   | `/api/games/{id}/join`           | Register the current user for the game      |
| `POST`   | `/api/games/{id}/skip`           | Mark the current user as skipped            |
| `POST`   | `/api/games/{id}/guests`         | Add a guest linked to the current user      |
| `DELETE` | `/api/games/{id}/guests`         | Remove the current user's most-recent guest |

Each mutating action (join/skip/+1/-1) calls the corresponding management service endpoint with the player ID from the JWT. The management service's `ParticipationService` fires `Notifier.EditGameMessage(ctx, gameID)` asynchronously after each mutation to re-fetch participants and edit the Telegram announcement in place. Returns the updated `GameParticipants` payload to the frontend so the UI refreshes without a second round-trip.

**`GameNotifier`** (`cmd/management/service/game_notifier.go`): concrete implementation of the `Notifier` interface. Fetches game + participants + guests, re-formats the message and keyboard via `gameformat`, then calls `EditMessageText` via the `TelegramAPI` interface. Resolves the group timezone via `resolveGroupTimezone` in `group_resolver.go` (falls back to the default location on invalid IANA strings).

### Message Formatting
- Emoji header, game date/time, court list, optional venue line (`📍 Name`), numbered player list, guest list
- Capacity line: `courts_count × 2`
- "Last updated: [timestamp]" footer
- "Game completed ✓" marker for finished games

## Sports Booking Service

A standalone HTTP service (port 8081) that wraps the reverse-engineered Eversports.de internal API. All endpoints except `/health` and `/version` require `Authorization: Bearer <INTERNAL_API_SECRET>`.

### Eversports API (reverse-engineered)

**Login** — `POST https://www.eversports.de/api/checkout`
- GraphQL mutation `LoginCredentialLogin` with `credentials: {email, password}` and `params: {origin, region, ...}`
- Session established via the `et` cookie (UUID, 30 days, httpOnly, secure, SameSite=None) set in the response
- Response body may be empty; cookie presence in the jar is the success signal

**Single match** — `POST https://www.eversports.de/api/checkout` (GraphQL `Match` query by UUID)
- Returns structured data: id, start/end (RFC3339), state, sport, venue, court, price

**Booking timezone constraint** (`CreateBooking`): `start`/`end` must carry the facility's local timezone offset — Eversports rejects UTC (`Z`) timestamps. Pass times in the group's local timezone; do NOT call `.UTC()` before passing.

### HTTP endpoints

All endpoints except `/health` and `/version` require `Authorization: Bearer <INTERNAL_API_SECRET>`.
Authentication with Eversports is handled automatically: the service logs in on the first request and re-authenticates if the session expires.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET`  | `/health` | Liveness probe (no auth) |
| `GET`  | `/version` | Service version (no auth) |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/eversports/matches?date=YYYY-MM-DD[&startTime=HHMM][&endTime=HHMM][&my=true\|false]` | Court reservations for a date from the Eversports `/api/slot` endpoint. Each item is a time slot on a specific court; `booking != null` means reserved. Optional `startTime`/`endTime` filter to a time window (inclusive); optional `my` filters by user ownership (`isUserBookingOwner`). Requires `EVERSPORTS_FACILITY_ID`, `EVERSPORTS_FACILITY_SLUG` (courts are resolved dynamically) |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/eversports/matches` | Create a booking; body `{courtUuid, start, end, email?, password?}` (RFC 3339); optional `email`/`password` use a per-credential Eversports session. Returns `{bookingUuid, bookingId, matchId}` (`matchId` omitted if match creation failed). Requires `EVERSPORTS_FACILITY_UUID` |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/eversports/matches/{id}` | Fetch single booking by match UUID (the `matchId` returned by `POST /matches`). Optional headers `X-Eversports-Email` + `X-Eversports-Password` use a per-credential Eversports session. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/eversports/matches/{id}` | Cancel a booking by match UUID (`matchId` from `POST /matches`, **not** `bookingUuid`); returns `{id, state, relativeLink}`. Optional JSON body `{"email":"…","password":"…"}` uses a per-credential session; omit body for env-var default account. |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/eversports/courts[?date=YYYY-MM-DD]` | List courts at the facility; returns `[{id, uuid, name}]`. Parses `POST /api/booking/calendar/update` HTML. Optional `date` parameter (default: today). Requires `EVERSPORTS_FACILITY_ID`, `EVERSPORTS_FACILITY_SLUG` |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/eversports/facility?slug=<slug>` | Venue profile for a facility slug (e.g. `squash-house-berlin-03`); returns `{id, slug, name, rating, reviewCount, address, hideAddress, tags, contact, sports, city, company}`. `slug` query parameter is mandatory (400 if missing). |
