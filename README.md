# Squash Bot

A Telegram bot for coordinating squash games among a group of friends. The bot posts game announcements, lets players register with inline buttons, tracks capacity, and cleans up after each game.

## What It Does

- Admin creates a game via `/newgame` in private chat using a step-by-step wizard (date picker → venue/time → courts)
- Admin manages venues (courts, time slots, address) for their group via `/venues`
- Bot posts a formatted announcement to the group chat and pins it
- Players tap "I'm in" or "I'll skip" — the message updates in place
- Players can add guests (+1) linked to their name
- The night before the game the bot notifies if the headcount is off (too few or too many players)
- The morning after the game the bot unpins the message, removes buttons, and marks the game complete
- The bot sends a weekly reminder to admins if no game is scheduled for the upcoming week

## Architecture

```
telegram-squash-bot  →  HTTP API  →  squash-games-management  →  PostgreSQL
```

Two independently deployable binaries in one Go module:

- **squash-games-management** — REST API (port 8080), business logic, SQL repositories, cron scheduler; sends Telegram messages for scheduled notifications
- **telegram-squash-bot** — long-polling bot loop, message/callback handlers, slash commands; all data operations go through HTTP calls to the management service

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- The bot added as an admin to your group (so it can pin messages)

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in the required values:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=     # from @BotFather
INTERNAL_API_SECRET=    # shared secret between the two services — generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
TIMEZONE=UTC
```

`DATABASE_URL` is pre-configured in `docker-compose.yml` for the management service container and does not need to be in `.env` when running via Docker Compose.

### 2. Start

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Migrations run automatically on startup.

### 3. Add the bot to your group

Add the bot to a Telegram group and grant it admin rights (required for pinning messages). The bot will register the group automatically and start accepting game creation requests from group admins.

### 4. (Optional) Configure venues

In private chat with the bot, run `/venues`. You can add one or more venues for your group. Each venue stores a name, available court numbers, and preset time slots. Once venues are configured, the game creation wizard uses them to offer guided selections.

### 5. Create a game

In private chat with the bot, run `/newgame`. The bot will guide you through a wizard:

**With venues configured:**
1. **Pick a date** — tap one of the date buttons (today + next 13 days)
2. **Select a venue** — or "No venue / manual" to enter courts and time manually
3. **Toggle courts** — tap courts to select/deselect, then confirm
4. **Select a time slot** — or tap "Custom time" to type a time manually

**Without venues:**
1. **Pick a date** — tap one of the date buttons
2. **Enter the time** — type the time in `HH:MM` format (e.g. `19:30`)
3. **Enter the courts** — type the court numbers (e.g. `2,3,4` or `2 3 4`)

If you are an admin in multiple groups, the bot will ask you to pick a group after the courts step.

## Running Locally (without Docker)

```bash
# Start only the database
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Run the management service (in one terminal)
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"   # if Go installed via Homebrew on macOS
DATABASE_URL=postgres://squash_bot:squash_bot@localhost:7432/squash_bot \
  TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token> \
  INTERNAL_API_SECRET=<secret> \
  go run cmd/squash-games-management/main.go

# Run the telegram bot (in another terminal)
MANAGEMENT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
  TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token> \
  INTERNAL_API_SECRET=<secret> \
  go run cmd/telegram-squash-bot/main.go
```

## Testing

```bash
go test ./...                                      # all tests
go test -tags integration -timeout 120s ./...      # integration tests (requires test DB)
```

## Bot Commands

| Command      | Who can use     | Description                                      |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `/start`     | Anyone          | Show welcome message                             |
| `/help`      | Anyone          | List available commands                          |
| `/my_game`   | Anyone          | Show your next registered game with a link       |
| `/games`     | Group admins    | List upcoming games you manage; edit/manage them |
| `/newgame`   | Group admins    | Create a new game for your group (wizard)        |
| `/venues`    | Group admins    | Manage venues (courts, time slots, address)      |
| `/language`  | Group admins    | Set the bot language for a group (en/de/ru)      |
| `/trigger`   | Service admins  | Manually fire a scheduled event (private chat only); requires `SERVICE_ADMIN_IDS` |

## Localisation

The bot supports three languages: **English** (default), **German**, and **Russian**.

- **Group messages** (game announcements, capacity notifications, weekly reminders) use the language configured for that group.
- **Private messages** use the language from the user's Telegram client (`LanguageCode`), falling back to English if the language is unsupported.

Group admins set the language with `/language`. If the admin manages multiple groups, the bot first asks which group to configure, then shows the language picker. The setting is stored per group and survives bot restarts.

## Guest Management

Any group member can add a guest to a game by tapping the "+1 Guest" button. Each guest entry is linked to the player who invited them and is displayed as "+1 (invited by @username)". Players can remove their own most-recently-added guest. Admins can remove any specific guest via the `/games` management menu.

Guest spots count toward capacity.

|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day-before check  | 8 PM daily      | Checks if player count matches court capacity, notifies if not    |
| Day-after cleanup | 8 AM daily      | Unpins message, removes buttons, marks game complete              |
| Weekly reminder   | Monday 10 AM    | DMs group admins if no game is scheduled within the next 7 days   |

Capacity per game = `courts_count × 2`.

## Group Management

The bot tracks which groups it belongs to in the database. When added to a group:

- If it has admin rights, it is immediately ready for use.
- If it does **not** have admin rights, it DMs the user who added it with instructions.

When the bot is promoted or demoted in a group, it updates its admin status accordingly. Groups are removed from the tracking table when the bot is kicked.
